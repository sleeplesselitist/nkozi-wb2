## Hackathon Metrics (World Build II)

- **Uses World Wallet:** Yes — supports World App WalletAuth on `/login` (desktop mock fallback included).
- **Uses Proof of Human:** Yes — World ID Verify (Orb) flow on `/login`. For MVP we accept the payload server‑side to set `verified=true`; plan to swap to Cloud Verifier post‑submission.
- **Uses both together:** Yes — verified humans can upload/play and earn simulated WLD (+0.3 per qualified listen, daily cap); users can tip artists; flows depend on wallet + verification state.
- **Leverages World’s unique aspects:** Human‑verified attention (anti‑sybil) + wallet‑native payouts enable fair, global music discovery.# nkozi-wb2
